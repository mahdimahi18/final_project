				<p>Hi, my name is Mahdi Mahi. I am working as an electrical engineer at Boeing. 
					My work mainly focuses on firmware design and development. I have always had an interest in web-development. 
					It seems like every page is built by taking some lego blocks and putting them together. 
					Also, I want to explore different career fields. To learn about HTML, CSS, frameworks in depth, 
					I enrolled to this class.</p>
			
				<p>I am originally from a small town named Mymensingh in Bangladesh. I grew up there and came to USA in 2012. 
					Here, I finished my high school in Queens, NY and then went to Stony Brook University. 
					I finished my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and started my first job in Boeing. I realized In today's world, 
					where everything is becoming software-oriented, having good knowledge of software is very important. While being 
					actively present in the professional world, I realized how valuable it is to expand knowledge in all different 
					fields such as hardware, firmware, software. I am learning about hardware and firmware from my current workplace. 
					To learn about the software side and become a more knowledgable engineer, I enrolled into Software Development 
					Master's program at Boston University.</p>
			
				<p>Currently I am working on Boeing's MQ25 aircraft. This is an unmanned aircraft which can refuel airplane in air. 
					You can watch a video of MQ25 refueling an FA-18 here:</p>

<!-- I followed this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXkqy0b4M5g&ab_channel=developedbyed to build my nav bar. This video is 4 years old and some of 
the things don't work anymore. So, I made some modifications. -->
